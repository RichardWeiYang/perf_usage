Unlike other tools, we usually build perf from source code. While the step
sounds easy.

# Get source code

```
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
```

# Build from Source

```
cd linux/tools/perf/
make
```

Then you would see **perf** in the same directory.

For more detail, take a look at [Building][1].
